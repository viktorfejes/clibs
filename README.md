# Personal C Library
Types, containers, algorithms, and anything similar collected into my own library. As long as I work with C it will be under development -- fixing, tinkering as I go.

# Current implementations
- Dynamic Arrays (darray.h)
- Hashmap (hashmap.h)
- String (str.h)
- Sparse Set (sparse_set.h)
- Memory (mem.h)
- Threads & Mutexes (thread.h)
- Timer (timer.h)
