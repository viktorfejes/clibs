# vf header-only C/C++ libraries
Small (hopefully portable) header-only libraries that can be useful for tiny C/C++ projects. All libraries follow the [stb conventions](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt). The aim of these libraries are not necessarily performance but rather convenience. **Currently under development. Don't use in production!**

## Current implementations
